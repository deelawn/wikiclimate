The top US cities are scraped from the top US cities Wikipedia page

You'll need to install beautiful soup 4 before running this.  Also make sure that you have the python mysql connector installed.
Next open wikiscrape.py and change your database logon information.  Then you should be good to go.
It's kind of nice to be able to query climate data.
